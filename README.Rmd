# hcdb

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of hcdb is to provide an easy way to load in data from the Australian HCDB data project. 


## Installation

You can install the development version of hcdb from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("palesl/hcdb")
```

## Example

How to use the data. 
```{r example}
library(hcdb)

data<-justice_decision

```

If you'd like coded categorical data as factors (for analysis), then: 

```{r example2}
 
data<-haven::as_factor(justice_decision, only_labelled=TRUE)

```
If you prefer the data in Stata, SPSS, or Excel formats, you can access at [aushighcourtdatabase.org](https://aushighcourtdatabase.org).
